Week 2: Implementing Security Measures

In this section, I have been familiarized by words like validator library, sanitize input, password hashing, bcrypt and for enhancing authentication ; use "helmet.js" to secure http headers and use of https instead of http.
This week assignment is totally relevant to fixing vulnerabilities and how to secure data and how to enhance authentication. Code is given in assignment but as I am not a programmer or developer; so I have learnt about the terminologies as mentioned above. I have read about these ones that what are these terminologies meant by? and how can we use these ones accordingly and what are the benefits of using these ones.
